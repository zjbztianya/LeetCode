# [76. Minimum Window Substring](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/minimum-window-substring/)
Given a string S and a string T, find the minimum window in S which will contain all the characters in T in complexity O(n).

**Example:**


<pre><strong>Input: S</strong> = &#34;ADOBECODEBANC&#34;, <strong>T</strong> = &#34;ABC&#34;
<strong>Output:</strong> &#34;BANC&#34;
</pre>

**Note:**


- If there is no such window in S that covers all characters in T, return the empty string <code>&#34;&#34;</code>.
- If there is such window, you are guaranteed that there will always be only one unique minimum window in S.
