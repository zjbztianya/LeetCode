# [81. Search in Rotated Sorted Array II](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/search-in-rotated-sorted-array-ii/)
Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.

(i.e., <code>[0,0,1,2,2,5,6]</code> might become <code>[2,5,6,0,0,1,2]</code>).

You are given a target value to search. If found in the array return <code>true</code>, otherwise return <code>false</code>.

**Example 1:**


<pre><strong>Input:</strong> nums = [2<code>,5,6,0,0,1,2]</code>, target = 0
<strong>Output:</strong> true
</pre>

**Example 2:**


<pre><strong>Input:</strong> nums = [2<code>,5,6,0,0,1,2]</code>, target = 3
<strong>Output:</strong> false</pre>

**Follow up:**


- This is a follow up problem to [Search in Rotated Sorted Array](/problems/search-in-rotated-sorted-array/description/), where <code>nums</code> may contain duplicates.
- Would this affect the run-time complexity? How and why?
