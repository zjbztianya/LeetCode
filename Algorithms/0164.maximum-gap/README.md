# [164. Maximum Gap](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/maximum-gap/)
Given an unsorted array, find the maximum difference between the successive elements in its sorted form.

Return 0 if the array contains less than 2 elements.

**Example 1:**


<pre><strong>Input:</strong> [3,6,9,1]
<strong>Output:</strong> 3
<strong>Explanation:</strong> The sorted form of the array is [1,3,6,9], either
             (3,6) or (6,9) has the maximum difference 3.</pre>

**Example 2:**


<pre><strong>Input:</strong> [10]
<strong>Output:</strong> 0
<strong>Explanation:</strong> The array contains less than 2 elements, therefore return 0.</pre>

**Note:**


- You may assume all elements in the array are non-negative integers and fit in the 32-bit signed integer range.
- Try to solve it in linear time/space.
