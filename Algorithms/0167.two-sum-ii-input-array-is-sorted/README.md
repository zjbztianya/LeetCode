# [167. Two Sum II - Input array is sorted](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/two-sum-ii-input-array-is-sorted/)
Given an array of integers that is already **_sorted in ascending order_**, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number.

The function twoSum should return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to the target, where index1 must be less than index2.

**Note:**


- Your returned answers (both index1 and index2) are not zero-based.
- You may assume that each input would have _exactly_ one solution and you may not use the _same_ element twice.

**Example:**


<pre><strong>Input:</strong> numbers = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
<strong>Output:</strong> [1,2]
<strong>Explanation:</strong> The sum of 2 and 7 is 9. Therefore index1 = 1, index2 = 2.</pre>
