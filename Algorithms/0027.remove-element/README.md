# [27. Remove Element](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/remove-element/)
Given an array _nums_ and a value _val_, remove all instances of that value [**in-place**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm) and return the new length.

Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by **modifying the input array [in-place](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm)** with O(1) extra memory.

The order of elements can be changed. It doesn&#39;t matter what you leave beyond the new length.

**Example 1:**


<pre>Given <em>nums</em> = <strong>[3,2,2,3]</strong>, <em>val</em> = <strong>3</strong>,

Your function should return length = <strong>2</strong>, with the first two elements of <em>nums</em> being <strong>2</strong>.

It doesn&#39;t matter what you leave beyond the returned length.
</pre>

**Example 2:**


<pre>Given <em>nums</em> = <strong>[0,1,2,2,3,0,4,2]</strong>, <em>val</em> = <strong>2</strong>,

Your function should return length = <strong><code>5</code></strong>, with the first five elements of <em><code>nums</code></em> containing <strong><code>0</code></strong>, <strong><code>1</code></strong>, <strong><code>3</code></strong>, <strong><code>0</code></strong>, and <strong>4</strong>.

Note that the order of those five elements can be arbitrary.

It doesn&#39;t matter what values are set beyond the returned length.</pre>

**Clarification:**

Confused why the returned value is an integer but your answer is an array?

Note that the input array is passed in by **reference**, which means modification to the input array will be known to the caller as well.

Internally you can think of this:


<pre>// <strong>nums</strong> is passed in by reference. (i.e., without making a copy)
int len = removeElement(nums, val);

// any modification to <strong>nums</strong> in your function would be known by the caller.
// using the length returned by your function, it prints the first <strong>len</strong> elements.
for (int i = 0; i &lt; len; i++) {
    print(nums[i]);
}</pre>
