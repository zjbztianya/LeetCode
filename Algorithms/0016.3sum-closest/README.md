# [16. 3Sum Closest](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/3sum-closest/)
Given an array <code>nums</code> of _n_ integers and an integer <code>target</code>, find three integers in <code>nums</code> such that the sum is closest to <code>target</code>. Return the sum of the three integers. You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution.

**Example:**


<pre>Given array nums = [-1, 2, 1, -4], and target = 1.

The sum that is closest to the target is 2. (-1 + 2 + 1 = 2).
