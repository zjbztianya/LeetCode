# [1. Two Sum](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/two-sum/)
Given an array of integers, return **indices** of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.

You may assume that each input would have **_exactly_** one solution, and you may not use the _same_ element twice.

**Example:**


<pre>Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,

Because nums[<strong>0</strong>] + nums[<strong>1</strong>] = 2 + 7 = 9,
return [<strong>0</strong>, <strong>1</strong>].
</pre>
