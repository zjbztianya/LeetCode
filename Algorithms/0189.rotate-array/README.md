# [189. Rotate Array](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/rotate-array/)
Given an array, rotate the array to the right by _k_ steps, where _k_ is non-negative.

**Example 1:**


<pre><strong>Input:</strong> <code>[1,2,3,4,5,6,7]</code> and <em>k</em> = 3
<strong>Output:</strong> <code>[5,6,7,1,2,3,4]</code>
<strong>Explanation:</strong>
rotate 1 steps to the right: <code>[7,1,2,3,4,5,6]</code>
rotate 2 steps to the right: <code>[6,7,1,2,3,4,5]
</code>rotate 3 steps to the right: <code>[5,6,7,1,2,3,4]</code>
</pre>

**Example 2:**


<pre><strong>Input:</strong> <code>[-1,-100,3,99]</code> and <em>k</em> = 2
<strong>Output:</strong> [3,99,-1,-100]
<strong>Explanation:</strong> 
rotate 1 steps to the right: [99,-1,-100,3]
rotate 2 steps to the right: [3,99,-1,-100]
</pre>

**Note:**
