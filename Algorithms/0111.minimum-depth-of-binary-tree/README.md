# [111. Minimum Depth of Binary Tree](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/minimum-depth-of-binary-tree/)
Given a binary tree, find its minimum depth.

The minimum depth is the number of nodes along the shortest path from the root node down to the nearest leaf node.

**Note:** A leaf is a node with no children.

**Example:**

Given binary tree <code>[3,9,20,null,null,15,7]</code>,


<pre>    3
   / \
  9  20
    /  \
   15   7</pre>

return its minimum depth = 2.
