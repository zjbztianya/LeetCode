# [120. Triangle](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/triangle/)
Given a triangle, find the minimum path sum from top to bottom. Each step you may move to adjacent numbers on the row below.

For example, given the following triangle


<pre>[
     [<strong>2</strong>],
    [<strong>3</strong>,4],
   [6,<strong>5</strong>,7],
  [4,<strong>1</strong>,8,3]
]
</pre>

The minimum path sum from top to bottom is <code>11</code> (i.e., **2** + **3** + **5** + **1** = 11).

**Note:**

Bonus point if you are able to do this using only _O_(_n_) extra space, where _n_ is the total number of rows in the triangle.
