# [112. Path Sum](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/path-sum/)
Given a binary tree and a sum, determine if the tree has a root-to-leaf path such that adding up all the values along the path equals the given sum.

**Note:** A leaf is a node with no children.

**Example:**

Given the below binary tree and <code>sum = 22</code>,


<pre>      <strong>5</strong>
     <strong>/</strong> \
    <strong>4</strong>   8
   <strong>/</strong>   / \
  <strong>11</strong>  13  4
 /  <strong>\</strong>      \
7    <strong>2</strong>      1
</pre>

return true, as there exist a root-to-leaf path <code>5-&gt;4-&gt;11-&gt;2</code> which sum is 22.
