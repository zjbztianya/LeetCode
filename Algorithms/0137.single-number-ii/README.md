# [137. Single Number II](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/single-number-ii/)
Given a **non-empty** array of integers, every element appears _three_ times except for one, which appears exactly once. Find that single one.

**Note:**

Your algorithm should have a linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it without using extra memory?

**Example 1:**


<pre><strong>Input:</strong> [2,2,3,2]
<strong>Output:</strong> 3
</pre>

**Example 2:**


<pre><strong>Input:</strong> [0,1,0,1,0,1,99]
<strong>Output:</strong> 99</pre>
