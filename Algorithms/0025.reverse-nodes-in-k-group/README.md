# [25. Reverse Nodes in k-Group](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/reverse-nodes-in-k-group/)
Given a linked list, reverse the nodes of a linked list _k_ at a time and return its modified list.

_k_ is a positive integer and is less than or equal to the length of the linked list. If the number of nodes is not a multiple of _k_ then left-out nodes in the end should remain as it is.



**Example:**

Given this linked list: <code>1-&gt;2-&gt;3-&gt;4-&gt;5</code>

For _k_ = 2, you should return: <code>2-&gt;1-&gt;4-&gt;3-&gt;5</code>

For _k_ = 3, you should return: <code>3-&gt;2-&gt;1-&gt;4-&gt;5</code>

**Note:**


- Only constant extra memory is allowed.
- You may not alter the values in the list&#39;s nodes, only nodes itself may be changed.
