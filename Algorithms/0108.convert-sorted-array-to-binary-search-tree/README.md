# [108. Convert Sorted Array to Binary Search Tree](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/convert-sorted-array-to-binary-search-tree/)
Given an array where elements are sorted in ascending order, convert it to a height balanced BST.

For this problem, a height-balanced binary tree is defined as a binary tree in which the depth of the two subtrees of _every_ node never differ by more than 1.

**Example:**


<pre>Given the sorted array: [-10,-3,0,5,9],

One possible answer is: [0,-3,9,-10,null,5], which represents the following height balanced BST:

      0
     / \
   -3   9
   /   /
 -10  5
</pre>
