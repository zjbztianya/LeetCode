# [202. Happy Number](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/happy-number/)
Write an algorithm to determine if a number is &#34;happy&#34;.

A happy number is a number defined by the following process: Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits, and repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1. Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy numbers.

**Example: **


<pre><strong>Input:</strong> 19
<strong>Output:</strong> true
<strong>Explanation: 
</strong>1<sup>2</sup> + 9<sup>2</sup> = 82
8<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>2</sup> = 68
6<sup>2</sup> + 8<sup>2</sup> = 100
1<sup>2</sup> + 0<sup>2</sup> + 0<sup>2</sup> = 1
