# [187. Repeated DNA Sequences](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/repeated-dna-sequences/)
All DNA is composed of a series of nucleotides abbreviated as A, C, G, and T, for example: &#34;ACGAATTCCG&#34;. When studying DNA, it is sometimes useful to identify repeated sequences within the DNA.

Write a function to find all the 10-letter-long sequences (substrings) that occur more than once in a DNA molecule.

**Example:**


<pre><strong>Input:</strong> s = &#34;AAAAACCCCCAAAAACCCCCCAAAAAGGGTTT&#34;

<strong>Output:</strong> [&#34;AAAAACCCCC&#34;, &#34;CCCCCAAAAA&#34;]
</pre>
