# [88. Merge Sorted Array](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/merge-sorted-array/)
Given two sorted integer arrays _nums1_ and _nums2_, merge _nums2_ into _nums1_ as one sorted array.

**Note:**


- The number of elements initialized in _nums1_ and _nums2_ are _m_ and _n_ respectively.
- You may assume that _nums1_ has enough space (size that is greater or equal to _m_ + _n_) to hold additional elements from _nums2_.

**Example:**


<pre><strong>Input:</strong>
nums1 = [1,2,3,0,0,0], m = 3
nums2 = [2,5,6],       n = 3

<strong>Output:</strong> [1,2,2,3,5,6]
</pre>
