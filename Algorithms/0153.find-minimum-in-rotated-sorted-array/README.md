# [153. Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/find-minimum-in-rotated-sorted-array/)
Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.

(i.e., <code>[0,1,2,4,5,6,7]</code> might become <code>[4,5,6,7,0,1,2]</code>).

Find the minimum element.

You may assume no duplicate exists in the array.

**Example 1:**


<pre><strong>Input:</strong> [3,4,5,1,2] 
<strong>Output:</strong> 1
</pre>

**Example 2:**


<pre><strong>Input:</strong> [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]
<strong>Output:</strong> 0
</pre>
