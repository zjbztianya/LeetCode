# [213. House Robber II](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/house-robber-ii/)
You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed. All houses at this place are **arranged in a circle.** That means the first house is the neighbor of the last one. Meanwhile, adjacent houses have security system connected and **it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night**.

Given a list of non-negative integers representing the amount of money of each house, determine the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight **without alerting the police**.

**Example 1:**


<pre><strong>Input:</strong> [2,3,2]
<strong>Output:</strong> 3
<strong>Explanation:</strong> You cannot rob house 1 (money = 2) and then rob house 3 (money = 2),
             because they are adjacent houses.
</pre>

**Example 2:**


<pre><strong>Input:</strong> [1,2,3,1]
<strong>Output:</strong> 4
<strong>Explanation:</strong> Rob house 1 (money = 1) and then rob house 3 (money = 3).
             Total amount you can rob = 1 + 3 = 4.</pre>
