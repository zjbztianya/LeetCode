# [33. Search in Rotated Sorted Array](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/search-in-rotated-sorted-array/)
Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.

(i.e., <code>[0,1,2,4,5,6,7]</code> might become <code>[4,5,6,7,0,1,2]</code>).

You are given a target value to search. If found in the array return its index, otherwise return <code>-1</code>.

You may assume no duplicate exists in the array.

Your algorithm&#39;s runtime complexity must be in the order of _O_(log _n_).

**Example 1:**


<pre><strong>Input:</strong> nums = [<code>4,5,6,7,0,1,2]</code>, target = 0
<strong>Output:</strong> 4
</pre>

**Example 2:**


<pre><strong>Input:</strong> nums = [<code>4,5,6,7,0,1,2]</code>, target = 3
<strong>Output:</strong> -1</pre>
